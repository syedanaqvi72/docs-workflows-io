# Introduction
 A Workflow in GRiPO is a series of automated actions triggered by logic or events. It connects multiple cloud environments, applies decision rules, and executes tasks without manual intervention.

Workflows help teams automate operations, respond to real-time events, and standardize processes across Azure and Amazon environments — saving time and reducing human error.

#### Benefits of Workflows
* Save Time – Automate repetitive tasks and reuse logic.
* Reduce Errors – Standardize processes with decision-based flows.
* Multi-Cloud Control – Manage Azure & AWS operations from one place.
* Flexible Automation – Add loops, conditions, and parallel paths.
* Real-Time Monitoring – View status, logs, and control workflows easily.
* Scalable – Start simple and expand as your needs grow.

GRiPO Workflows let you design, execute, and monitor automation across multiple cloud platforms using an intuitive visual builder.

You can create flows for:
* Azure Management Clusters
* Azure Cost Management
* Amazon Management Clusters
* Amazon Cost Management
* Core Logic Actions like Loop, If/Else, Parallel Path, Webhooks, and more.

This eliminates complex scripting and switching between multiple dashboards.
