#### Key Modules at a Glance
On the Dashboard, you’ll find quick access to Gripo Flow’s key modules:
* <b> Connections </b>:<br />
Connections let you<b> securely link APIs, databases, cloud services, and external platforms </b>with Gripo Flow. They serve as the foundation for building automated workflows, enabling seamless and secure data flow between different systems without repetitive setup.
* <b> Workflows</b>:<br />
A Workflow in Gripo Flow is a step-by-step automation that connects your cloud environments, applies business logic, and reacts to real-time events — all without manual intervention.
You can think of it as your digital operations engine. Instead of executing repetitive steps by hand, a workflow runs them automatically based on defined triggers, actions, and conditions.
* <b> Plugins</b>:<br />
A Plugin in Gripo Flow extends the platform’s functionality by integrating third-party services, custom logic, or pre-built features into your workflows.
Instead of developing every feature from the ground up, plugins provide <b>ready-to-use capabilities</b> such as cost management tools, monitoring integrations, or data transformation functions—that seamlessly integrate with your workflows and connections.
Plugins make your automation<b> more powerful, adaptable, and aligned with your operational goals</b>
* <b> AI Agents</b>:<br />
An <b>AI Agent</b> in Gripo Flow is your <b>intelligent assistant </b>for managing clusters and cloud environments through natural language.
Instead of using complex commands or switching dashboards, simply talk to your infrastructure. AI Agents can check resources, run tasks, and give real-time insights across multiple clusters.
You can <b>create custom AI Agents</b> for different use cases — like Kubernetes operations, cost monitoring, or maintenance — making your workflows faster, smarter, and easier for everyone.
