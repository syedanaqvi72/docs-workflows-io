<b> Step 2:</b>
<br />
Next, the procedure is pressing the <b>'Sync' </b>button to initiate synchronisation and configuration of the designated area on the platform. This methodical process highlights an organised and efficient way to configure regions in the Gripo environment, ensuring quick and easy virtual machine development.

<b> Third Step: </b><br />

Upon the synchronization's completion, users can proceed with VM creation by choosing their preferred VM from the provided list and selecting the <b>"Add Virtual Machine"</b> button. This uncomplicated procedure optimizes the workflow for creating VMs, allowing users to efficiently provision the required virtual infrastructure.

<b> Fouth Step:</b>
<br />
Once the VM is successfully added, users can promptly identify their desired virtual machine from the comprehensive list displayed. This streamlined process ensures that the newly created VM is readily visible among the array of available options, facilitating swift access and management within the platform's interface.

<b> Fifth Step: </b>
<br />
With Gripo, users can fix mistakes by eliminating accidentally chosen Virtual Machines
(VMs) from their account. In order to accomplish this, users only need to pick the
incorrectly selected virtual machine (VM) from the list and then press the "Select
" button. In order to delete the chosen virtual machine from the list, users only
need to click on the "Delete" button. By taking this action, the selected virtual
machine will be permanently removed from the user's list of selected machines on
the Gripo platform, starting the VM deletion process.
