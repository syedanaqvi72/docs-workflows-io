#### Regions in Amazon

- When creating a region within the Gripo platform, users must first select their preferred region from the available options. This choice is crucial as it determines the geographic location where the cloud provider's data centers will be deployed. Gripo's integration with multiple cloud providers allows users to select specific regions based on performance, compliance, and disaster recovery requirements.

- In the Gripo platform, the 'Selected Region' button conveniently presents a list of regions that are currently available or have been manually added by the user. Initially, this list includes pre-existing regions within the platform. Furthermore, any newly added region by the user seamlessly integrates into the 'Selected Region' list, ensuring easy access and efficient management of regions within the platform.

- When user click on the sync button after selecting a VM from the list, Gripo will connect to the VM and retrieve its current configuration. This information will then be compared to the configuration that is stored on the Gripo platform. If there are any differences, Gripo will make the necessary changes to the Region's configuration to bring it into sync with the Gripo platform.
