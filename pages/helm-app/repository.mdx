#### Repository 
<br />
In <b>Gripo</b>, a <b>Helm repository</b> is essential for deploying Helm applications, as it stores and distributes Helm charts. Without adding the repository, you cannot install or manage Helm applications in your cluster. Gripo makes this process seamless by allowing you to add repositories easily through the [Add Repository](/helm-app/repository/add_repo)  section. If a repository is no longer needed, you can remove it from the [Delete Repository](/helm-app/repository/delete_repo) section.
