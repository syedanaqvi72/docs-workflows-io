#### Export Template:

In addition to building templates within the platform, Gripo provides an export feature that lets users download their configurations. This promotes template portability and repeatability across multi-cloud deployments, including Amazon, Azure, DigitalOcean, Google, and Linode.

##### Export From Gripo:

* To initiate the export process, navigate to the Templates section and <b>select</b> the desired template.
