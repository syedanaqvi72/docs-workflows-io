#### Importing Google Cluster:
In the Gripo portal, users can conveniently import Google Kubernetes Service (GKS) clusters using two methods:

* [By secret](/cluster_managment/cluster_import/google/by-secret): Users can input the GKE cluster's secret credentials directly into the portal. These credentials typically include a service account key file in JSON format, which contains the necessary authentication details to enable secure access to the cluster.

* [By Config File](/cluster_managment/cluster_import/google/by-config): Users can upload a Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig) obtained from the Google portal or CLI. This file contains details about the GKS cluster's API server, authentication credentials, and namespaces. The Gripo portal processes this file to establish a seamless connection with the cluster.

Both methods are designed to simplify the integration of GKS clusters into Gripo while ensuring high security and flexibility for users. Gripo enables centralized cluster management, streamlined workflows, and enhanced features, making it a powerful tool for Kubernetes administrators.
