#### Importing Amazon Cluster:
In the Gripo portal, users can conveniently import Amazon Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters using two methods:

* [By secret](/cluster_managment/cluster_import/amazon/by-secret): Users can input the EKS cluster's secret credentials directly into the portal. These credentials typically include authentication tokens or keys, such as the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, enabling secure access to the cluster.

* [By Config File](/cluster_managment/cluster_import/amazon/by-config): Users can upload a Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig) obtained from the Amazon portal or CLI. This file contains details about the EKS cluster's API server, authentication credentials, and namespaces. The Gripo portal processes this file to establish a seamless connection with the cluster.

Both methods are designed to simplify the integration of EKS clusters into Gripo while ensuring high security and flexibility for users. Gripo enables centralized cluster management, streamlined workflows, and enhanced features, making it a powerful tool for Kubernetes administrators.
