#### Importing Linode Cluster:
In the Gripo portal, users can conveniently import Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKS) clusters using two methods:

* [By secret](/cluster_managment/cluster_import/linode/by-secret): Users can input the Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) cluster's secret credentials directly into the portal. These credentials typically include a Linode API token, which provides the necessary authentication to enable secure access to the cluster..

* [By Config File](/cluster_managment/cluster_import/linode/by-config): Users can upload a Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig) obtained from the Linode portal or CLI. This file contains details about the LKE cluster's API server, authentication credentials, and namespaces. The Gripo portal processes this file to establish a seamless connection with the cluster.

Both methods are designed to simplify the integration of LKE clusters into Gripo while ensuring high security and flexibility for users. Gripo enables centralized cluster management, streamlined workflows, and enhanced features, making it a powerful tool for Kubernetes administrators.
