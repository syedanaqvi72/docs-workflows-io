- Launching your EC2 role starts with picking its "boss": click <b> "AWS services" </b>in the trust selection. Then, define its job by choosing <b>"EC2" </b> as the use case, unlocking tailored permissions and policies for managing your instances seamlessly.

- Fueling your EKS role comes down to attaching the right permissions. Scan policies like "AmazonEKSClusterPolicy" or "AmazonEKSServicePolicy," choosing the ones that grant the precise access you need for managing the cluster or unlocking specific EKS services. Remember, these policies define what actions your role can perform, so pick wisely for a secure and well-defined access structure.

- Unleash your EC2 role's true power by attaching the perfect permissions. Scan through policies like <b> "AmazonEC2FullAccess" or "AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess,"</b> choosing those that grant the precise control you need for managing instances or unlocking specific EC2 features. Remember, these policies define your role's actions, so pick wisely for a secure and streamlined access setup.

- <b>Review </b>the role details, focusing on the trusted entity, use case
  (EC2), and assigned policies (EKS and EC2). Confirm precise alignment with
  intended functions. If needed, click 'Next: Tags'; otherwise, proceed by
  clicking <b>'Create Role'.</b>
